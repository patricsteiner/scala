   Exercise 2: Binary Search Tree
   Implement insert/lookup for Binary Search Tree.
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
   For each Node, every key in the left subtree should be less than the root's key.
   Likewise, every key in the right subtree should be greater than the root's key.
   Each time, comparator(cmp) will be given as an argument.
   You may assume that the same cmp has been used to build given tree.
   The result of cmp(k1, k2) should be interpreted as the following:
     negative: k1 < k2
     zero:     k1 == k2
     positive: k1 > k2
   For insert function, if the given key already exists in the given tree,
   you should overwrite it.
   For lookup function, return the result in Option type, meaning
     if the key exists -> Some(value)
     else -> None
